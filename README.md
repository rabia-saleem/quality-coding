# A simple Video Service

## Pair programming exercises
- functioning service - `LegacyVideoService.java`
- low quality code, hard to maintain
- dependent clients who consume the service as defined by its contract
- need to maintain contract and external behaviour (can't change code in `contract` package)
- task: make the changes to the code you believe would improve its quality
- free to make any change in any file in `recruitment` package you feel is necessary or beneficial
- there are a few simple unit tests that cover some happy path scenarios


## Executing the test suite
- Run `mvn test` or load this project into your favourite IDE and run the tests from there.
